This project is used to classify customers into segments based on behaviors (Churn probabililty).

Customer segmentation based on behavior is the process of grouping customers according to how they interact with a product or service. Instead of looking only at who customers are (demographics) or what they say they prefer (attitudinal), behavioral segmentation focuses on what customers actually do.
